We want to build a filter for companies, on some dimensions like Country, Industry, Revenue and Employees from user input. 
If the input text contains a certain dimension then it should be added in the filter object and if not then it should not be added in the filter object.

Filter on country dimension supports only the countries Sweden ("SE"), Norway ("NO"), Denmark ("DK") and Finland ("FI").
Example 1: If the user input asks about swedish companies the filter will be
{
	"filters": {
		"country_code":[
			"SE"
		]
	}

}


If the user input contains industry then we should add NACE codes for those industries in the filter. 
NACE codes in the filter should be of the following format SNI<BroadSector><SubSector>. For example: SNIB07100, 
here B is the BroadSector and 07100 is the SubSector. Both broad sector and sub sectors are required.
SubSector should always be of 5 characters. If they are of less than 5 characters fill them with padding X. 
For example: SNIB07100, SNIB089XX. 
Now for example if the user input asks about Information and Communication (SNIJXXXXX), Mining and Iron Ores (SNIB07100) then the filter object will be
{
	"filters": {
		"industry": [
            "SNIJXXXXX",
            "SNIB07100"
        ]
	}

}
Please try to provide the NACE codes as much specific as possible also it should have BoradSector like A,B,C,D,E and so on and SubSector.


Revenue dimension can be of four currencies and in two units: kEUR, mEUR, kNOK, mNOK, kSEK, mSEK, kDKK, mDKK
k means Thousand and m means Million. EUR means Euro, SEK means Swedish Kronor, NOK means Norwegian Kroner and DKK
means Danish Kroner.

Example 1: Revenue between 465.599 kNOK to 134217728 kNOK
{
	"filters": {
	    "revenue": {
	        "from": "465.599",
	        "to": "134217728",
	        "currency": "kNOK"
	    }
	}	
}

Example 2: Revenue more than 1000 kDKK
{
	"filters": {
	    "revenue": {
	        "from": "1000"
	        "currency": "kDKK"
	    }
	}	
}

Employees dimension name is employees. It has from and to attributes same as revenue dimension.

Example 1: Employees less than 50
{
	"filters": {
	    "employees": {
	        "to": "50"
	    }
	}	
}

More examples are given below:
